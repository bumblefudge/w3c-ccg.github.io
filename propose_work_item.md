# Proposing a work item

We're trying to make CCG participation easy. If you're not comfortable using Github, send an email to public-credentials@w3.org, and we'll help you out. 

If you are comfortable using Github, please follow the steps below.

tl;dr Create a Github issue using the "New Work Item" template and send an CCG email discussion list (public-credentials@w3.org)

1. Create a github issue using the "New Work Item" template at [https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues)
  - Include a link to an Abstract or Draft of proposed Work Item (typically a link to a google doc or a markdown page in Github, but anything is acceptable)
  - The editors responsible for advancing the Work Item. (Proposals may have a single editor; however, before approval of a Work Item it must have more than one editor, and editors must include representation from at least two companies.)
  - Note: the Github Work Item template autopopulates the following fields:
    - Labels the issue as “Proposed Work Item”
    - Prompts to add the editors’ contact information and Github handles to the issue


2. Send an email to the CCG mailing list Credentials Community Group <public-credentials@w3.org> with a link to the Github issue.
