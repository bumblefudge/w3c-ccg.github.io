# Creating spectext with markdown and bikeshed

## About

[Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) is a tool that generates specs (spectext html files) from simpler source files, such as markdown.

### Example

The BTCR DID method spec uses bikeshed for generating spectext. We edit the BTCR [index.bs file](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/didm-btcr/blob/gh-pages/index.bs), and then run bikeshed to generate the [index.html file](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/didm-btcr/blob/gh-pages/index.html). [The rendered output is shown here](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/).

### When to use

Spec authors/editors may prefer to use markdown and bikeshed for the following types of [CCG work items](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc):

- Community Notes
- Community Commentaries
- Earlier phases of Community Specifications

In later phases of Community Specifications, especially complex ones like the DID spec, participants may prefer direct diffs on the html for precision. 

### Known Issues

While easier to work with than spectext files, this still involves bikeshed tool install/run instructions, and therefore is not non-dev friendly. 

As a workaround, we could stand up a generation tool to allow people to run bikeshed in a browser.
